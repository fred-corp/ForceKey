# Force Key

![Force key image](hardware/Files/render.PNG)

## Description

The Force Key solid-state morse paddle key, which, as the name implies, uses force senors (load cells) to detect the user's input. It is designed to work in single-lever mode or twin-lever mode.  
The output is a standard 3.5mm stereo jack, which can be connected to any morse keyer or transceiver.

## Features

- Single-lever or twin-lever mode, or both at the same time
- Adjustable sensitivity in code
- TRS 3.5mm stereo jack output (tip = dot, ring = dash, sleeve = ground)
- Li-Ion battery powered
- USB-C port for charging
- Uses cheap Puya microcontroller

## Hardware

- PCB & other components in BOM
- 2x [100g load cells + HX711 amplifier](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005001537354199.html) (make sure to get the 100g version !)
- TODO: add more details

## Inspiration

The Force key is inspired by the [Solid State Paddle by 9A5N](https://www.9a5n.eu/paddle.html), which is a beautiful product; but because of my student budget, I decided to make my own version.  
It was a nice challenge as I wanted to use the Puya PY32F002A microcontroller, which is not very common in the maker community.  
I also wanted to machine the base and load cell supports myself, which was exciting as I don't get to use the mills and lathes of my university very often as I'm an EE student.

Please consider buying the original product if you can afford it, it's a great product and it's worth the price (thanks [F4IEY](https://github.com/f4iey) for showing it to me in the first place !).
